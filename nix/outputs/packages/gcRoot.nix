# - You can perform filtering on your roots which would be hard to do with
#   nix-direnv. For example, filtering your npins' pins based on which platforms they
#   apply to. This way, a macOS only pin won't have a GC root on Linux.
# - The option to show a diff of your dev shell when it changes. This useful for
#   verifying that a refactor doesn't change the dev shell or just seeing what has
#   changed.
# - Roots are joined into a single derivation so you'll only have a single GC root
#   per project. This is reduces noise in the full list of GC roots for your system
#   (/nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto).
