  # Workaround for doing the first `darwin-rebuild switch`. Since nix-darwin only
  # overwrites files that it knows the contents of, I have to take the add the hash
  # of my /etc/nix/nix.conf here before doing my first rebuild so it can overwrite
  # it. You can also move the existing nix.conf to another location, but then none of
  # my settings, like trusted-users, will be applied when I do the first rebuild. So
  # the plan is to temporarily add the hash here and once the first rebuild is done,
  # remove it. There's an open issue for having nix-darwin backup the file and
  # replace it instead of refusing to run[1].
  #
  # Also, this is an internal option so it may change without notice.
