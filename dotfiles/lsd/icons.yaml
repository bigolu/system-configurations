# The goal here is to only have icons for anything that isn"t a regular file, since regular files can already be
# identified by their file name and/or extension.

# Remove default icons for files with certain names or extensions, for reasons stated at the top of the file.
# Some of these names are directories though so they will be given an icon.
#
# TODO: This won"t cover icons that get added in the future for file extensions/names not listed here. Ideally I
# could use a regex to capture all file names/extensions.
