  # When filetype icons can have precedence over file name/extension icons then I'll start using
  # icons. This issue is for letting the directory icon have precedence over file type:
  # https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/965
  # Maybe a value you can set for the name/extension like "inherit" so it can take the value set for
  # the file type. Or maybe make the indicator icon and position configurable.
