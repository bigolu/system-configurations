  // Renovate recommends changing the branch prefix if you're self hosting to
  // avoid interference with the hosted Renovate[1]. For this reason I also
  // changed some other settings that may interfere with hosted Renovate. I
  // don't plan to run hosted Renovate alongside my self-hosted one, but if
  // I have a problem with my self-hosted Renovate, I can run the hosted one
  // alongside it to compare behaviors without worrying about them clashing.
