# System Configurations

This repository holds the [Home Manager][home-manager] and
[nix-darwin][nix-darwin] configurations for my machines. I don't expect anyone
else to use this, but I figured I'd leave the repo public as a resource for
people who want to manage their systems similarly.

## Applying a Configuration

### Configs

For reference, here are all the configs, grouped by system manager, in the
format "\<config_name> / \<platform>":

<!-- START_CONFIGURATIONS -->

- Home Manager

  - desktop / x86_64-linux

- nix-darwin

  - bigmac / x86_64-darwin

<!-- END_CONFIGURATIONS -->

### Steps

1. Install Nix using the [Determinate Systems Nix
   Installer][determinate-systems-installer]. After you download it, replace the
   platform (x86_64) in the URL below with that of your system and then run the
   command:

   > NOTE: The installer may have changed since this was written so make sure
   > everything below is still valid.

   ```bash
   ./nix-installer install \
     --nix-package-url https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.24.9/nix-2.24.9-x86_64-linux.tar.xz
   ```

2. Run the following command. It will start a fish shell within a Nix shell
   containing the other required programs, set the binary caches, and clone the
   repository:

   <!-- SYNC: SYS_CONF_PUBLIC_KEYS SYS_CONF_SUBS -->

   ```bash
   nix shell nixpkgs#fish nixpkgs#direnv nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#gitMinimal \
     --command fish --init-command '
       # Fish does not have a way to exit whenever a command fails so I am
       # manually adding `|| exit`.
       # https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/510

       echo "
         extra-trusted-public-keys = bigolu.cachix.org-1:AJELdgYsv4CX7rJkuGu5HuVaOHcqlOgR07ZJfihVTIw= nix-community.cachix.org-1:mB9FSh9qf2dCimDSUo8Zy7bkq5CX+/rkCWyvRCYg3Fs=
         extra-substituters = https://bigolu.cachix.org https://nix-community.cachix.org
       " | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf || exit

       # Reload the daemon so it picks up the configuration changes.
       if uname | grep -q Linux
         systemctl restart nix-daemon.service || exit
       else
         sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon || exit
       end

       direnv hook fish | source || exit
       git clone https://github.com/bigolu/system-configurations.git ~/code/system-configurations || exit
       cd ~/code/system-configurations || exit
       direnv allow || exit
       direnv exec "$PWD" nix-direnv-reload || exit
     '
   ```

3. The next steps depend on the operating system you're using:

   - Linux

     1. Apply a Home Manager configuration by running
        `just initialize home-manager <config_name>` where `<config_name>` is
        any compatible config from the [config list](#configs).

   - macOS

     1. Apply a nix-darwin configuration by running
        `just initialize nix-darwin <config_name>` where `<config_name>` is any
        compatible config from the [config list](#configs).

     2. Keyboard:

        - Set the keyboard input source to 'Others → (No Accent Keys)'.

        <!--
          I can automate shortcuts when this issue gets resolved:
          https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/185
        -->

        - Shortcuts:

          - Disable: "Select the previous input source" `ctrl+space`,
            "Application windows" `ctrl+↓`

          - Change: "Mission Control → Move left/right a space" to `cmd+[` and
            `cmd+]` respectively, "Mission Control" to `cmd+d`, "Mission Control
            → Switch to Desktop 1-9" `cmd+[1-9]`

     3. Open Hammerspoon, Finicky, MonitorControl, UnnaturalScrollWheels,
        Nightfall, and "Mac Mouse Fix" to configure them.

## Running the Portable Home Configuration

You can also run a shell with a home configuration already loaded in it. This is
helpful when you only need to use the configuration temporarily and not apply
it, like when you're on a remote host or in a container. You can download it
from the [releases page][releases].

### How it Works

A nix bundler takes a [Home Manager][home-manager] configuration and bundles all
of its dependencies, and the bundler itself, into a self-extracting archive
(SEA). When you execute the SEA, it unpacks the dependencies and rewrites any
paths referenced in a file that start with `/nix/store`. It rewrites these paths
to a symbolic link that it creates in `/tmp` with the same number of characters
(e.g. `/tmp/abcde`). It's important that the length of the new path be the same
as the length of `/nix/store`. This is because binaries usually read these paths
using offsets and so a longer/shorter path would change these offsets. The
symbolic link then points to the extracted contents of the SEA which is stored
in the system's temporary directory. This could also be `/tmp` or the path
pointed to by the environment variable `$TMPDIR`, if it's set. I found this idea
in a [GitHub issue comment regarding a "rootless Nix"][rootless-nix] and decided
to try and build it to learn more about Nix.
