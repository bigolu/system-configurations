# This script is for running direnv commands or just loading the direnv environment.
# It handles things that need to be done before running direnv:
#   - Get direnv and Bash, using the nix-shell shebang at the top
#   - Copy the sample .envrc to where direnv expects it to be
#   - Run `direnv allow`
#
# Since this script is not run from within the direnv environment, the shebang at the
# top works differently than the ones in other scripts:
#   - A relative path is used to access the package set instead of the
#     FLAKE_PACKAGE_SET_FILE environment variable. This is done because that variable
#     comes from the direnv environment.
#   - -I is used to set nixpkgs on the nix path. This is done because NIX_PATH is set
#     by the direnv environment.
#   - nix-shell is used instead of cached-nix-shell. This is done because
#     cached-nix-shell comes from the direnv environment.
#   - bash is used as the interpreter instead of nix-shell-interpreter. This is
#     because nix-shell-interpreter is only needed to work around an issue with
#     cached-nix-shell.
#
# Also worth noting that the path in -I is relative to the directory where this
# script is executed, which is assumed to be the root of the project, and the
# path in the import is relative to where the script file is.
