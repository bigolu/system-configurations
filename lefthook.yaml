# Git Hooks
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do not specify globs for any jobs that belong to a git hook because they won't be
# applied unless their run command uses `{files}`. You could get around this by
# adding something like `: {files};` to the beginning of every run command, but that
# would lead to a subtle bug if you ever forgot to add it. For custom hooks, I get
# around this by always specifying a `files` command at the hook level since the
# documentation[1] states that globs will always be applied if a `files` command is
# used. This does not seem to apply to git hooks though and I think that's a bug so I
# should report it. There was a pull request for always applying globs, but it was
# closed[2].
