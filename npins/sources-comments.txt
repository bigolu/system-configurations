- TODO: vim plugins should be upstreamed to nixpkgs
- TODO: fish-async-prompt doesn't seem to be making releases anymore. I should
  check with the author and possibly have nixpkgs track master instead.
- TODO: I should do a sparse checkout to get the single Hammerspoon Spoon I need.
  issue: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/5811
- I keep a nixpkgs-stable channel, in addition to unstable, since there's a
  higher chance that something builds on a stable channel.
