    # Run once every 6 days. I'd prefer to run it once a week, but GitHub Actions
    # evicts all cache entries that haven't been accessed in more than a week[1] so
    # I'm choosing 6 days to be safe since the precise start time of a scheduled
    # workflow is not guaranteed.
    #
    # I've also chosen minute 43 for the workflow to run to avoid running at
    # the start of the hour. This is because GitHub sees high load at the start of
    # every hour and when that happens, some queued jobs may be delayed or
    # dropped[2].
