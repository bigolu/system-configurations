    # The command run in the previous step fails if it updates any generated code.
    # This causes the step that it's run in to fail as well. If that happens, then by
    # default this step, and all steps after it, wouldn't get run. That means this
    # step wouldn't be able to report the generated code that got updated.
    #
    # We could have used `always()` to ensure this step runs, but that would mean
    # even if the workflow was cancelled by a user, this step would still run.
    # Instead, we say only run if the workflow wasn't cancelled. This way, we still
    # have the ability to cancel all the steps in the workflow while also allowing
    # this step to run even if previous ones fail.
