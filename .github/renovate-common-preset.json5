// TODO: Regarding the automerge settings: I used to have them in a separate preset,
// since they are repeated a few times in this config. However,
// `renovate-config-validator` would consider this config invalid, despite the fact
// that the `renovate` program had no problem using it. An issue was opened for this
// where a Renovate author said they never intended for presets to be used inside of
// package rules[1]. The issue has since gone stale, but maybe I should reopen it.
